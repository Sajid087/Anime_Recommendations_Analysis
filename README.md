# Anime Data Analysis Project 🎥📊

This project comprehensively analyzes an anime dataset, focusing on various aspects such as exploratory data analysis, relational data insights, demographic trends, and rating evaluations. The analysis is conducted using Jupyter Notebooks and the results are compiled into a detailed report.

## Project Overview 📚

The project is structured into several Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the dataset:

1. **1_EDA.ipynb**: Conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the anime dataset to understand its structure, clean the data, and visualize key patterns and relationships.

2. **2_Relations.ipynb**: Explores relationships between different attributes of anime, including correlation analysis and visualizations.

3. **4_Demographics.ipynb**: Analyzes the distribution of anime types and genres, providing insights into ratings and popularity.

4. **5_Low_Ratings.ipynb**: Focuses on low-rated anime, identifying common characteristics and factors contributing to lower ratings.

5. **6_Rating&Scores.ipynb**: Analyzes ratings and scores from two datasets (`anime.csv` and `rating.csv`), providing insights into the distribution and popularity of different anime.

## Analysis Steps 🔍

1. **Data Import and Initial Setup**: Import necessary libraries and load the datasets.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, convert data types, and remove duplicates to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Perform statistical analysis and create visualizations to explore various aspects of the dataset, such as:
   - Distribution of anime types and genres.
   - Correlation between different attributes.
   - Top-rated and low-rated anime characteristics.

4. **Insights and Results**: Compile insights from the analysis, highlighting key patterns, trends, and potential areas for further investigation.

## Results 📈

The analysis revealed several key insights:
- **Genre Trends**: Certain genres like 'Action' and 'Adventure' are more prevalent in TV series, while 'Drama' and 'Romance' are common in Movies.
- **Popularity and Ratings**: TV series tend to have higher average ratings and popularity, indicating a broader audience appeal.
- **Low-rated Anime**: OVAs and Movies are more prevalent among low-rated titles, with common genres including 'Hentai', 'Comedy', and 'Action'.
